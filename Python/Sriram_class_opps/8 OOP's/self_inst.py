## self is used to reffer the instance of the class to the method
## Based on self only method will get to know for which instace it has to responce
# More DESC:
'''
The self is used to represent the instance of the class. With this keyword, you can access the attributes and methods of the
class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.
The reason why we use self is that Python does not use the ‘@’ syntax to refer to instance attributes.
In Python, we have methods that make the instance to be passed automatically, but not received automatically.
